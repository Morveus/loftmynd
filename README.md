# Loftmynd

Loftmynd ("aerial" in Icelandic) is a work-in-progress project that aims to provide a 3D environment for home automation, leveraging the power of HomeAssistant for its backend. The project targets both iOS and Android platforms utilizing Unity 2021.3.16f1 for development.

It's a personal project aimed at being deployed on tablets in my home, that's been in the back of my mind for a long time.
